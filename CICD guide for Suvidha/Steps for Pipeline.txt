Adding an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to your AWS environment for your project running on port 8080 with autoscaling involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console: Go to the AWS Management Console and sign in with your credentials.

2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard: Once signed in, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "Services" from the top-left corner, and then selecting "EC2" under the "Compute" section.

3. Create a Target Group:
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section, select "Target Groups".
   - Click on the "Create target group" button.
   - Configure the target group:
     - Give your target group a name.
     - Select the target type as "Instance".
     - For "Protocol", choose "HTTP" if your application communicates over HTTP. If it's HTTPS, choose "HTTPS" and configure SSL accordingly.
     - For "Port", enter "8080" since your project is running on port 8080.
     - Configure other settings as per your requirements.
   - Click on "Create".

4. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Load Balancing" section, select "Load Balancers".
   - Click on the "Create Load Balancer" button.
   - Choose "Application Load Balancer" as the load balancer type.
   - Configure the load balancer:
     - Give your load balancer a name.
     - Configure listeners: Add a listener for HTTP on port 80, or HTTPS on port 443 if you're using SSL.
     - Configure availability zones and subnets.
     - Configure security settings as per your requirements.
     - Select the previously created target group.
     - Configure routing if needed.
   - Click on "Next: Configure Security Settings" and proceed with the security settings.
   - Review your configuration and click on "Create".

5. Configure Auto Scaling Group:
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard, under the "Auto Scaling" section, select "Auto Scaling Groups".
   - Select your auto scaling group.
   - Click on the "Edit" button.
   - In the "Load Balancing" section, select the ALB you created.
   - Configure health checks and other settings as per your requirements.
   - Click on "Save".

6. Update Security Groups:
   - Make sure your instances' security group allows traffic from the ALB on port 8080.
   - If necessary, update the security group to allow inbound traffic from the ALB.

7. Test: Once everything is configured, test your setup by accessing your application through the ALB's DNS name or IP address.

That's it! Your application should now be accessible through the ALB, and traffic should be evenly distributed across the instances in your auto scaling group.
